# Device Registry

A catalog of IoT devices we've documented (or are documenting).

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Research | Initial investigation |
| In Progress | Actively reverse engineering |
| Complete | Protocol fully documented |

## Guides

- [LED Sign & Panel Design Apps](led-sign-apps.md) — which app designs content for which LED
  panel family, and how to triage an unknown sign.
- [WiFi Discovery](wifi-discovery.md) — finding devices already on the network
- [Wemo Setup, Factory Reset and Rebinding](wemo-setup.md) — the worked provisioning example
- [Frigidaire Local API Audit](frigidaire-local-api-audit.md) — why some devices cannot be rescued
- [Initial Device Setup](../protocols/device-setup.md) — provisioning patterns across devices

## Devices

The **Setup** column records how a factory-fresh device is provisioned, and how
well that flow is understood. The full machine-readable version lives in each
spec's `device.setup` block; the patterns are explained in
[Initial Device Setup](../protocols/device-setup.md).

## Not everything here was liberated

Almost every entry above is a reconstruction — somebody worked the protocol out
from captures, firmware or an app teardown. A few are not, and specs say which
they are in `device.openness`:

| Status | Means |
|---|---|
| `open_by_design` | Published protocol; third-party clients are the point. Read upstream, not us |
| `documented_api` | Official interface exists, product otherwise closed. Part cited, part reconstructed |
| `undocumented` | Nothing published. Our best reconstruction — the default here, and the usual case |
| `hostile` | Vendor actively fights third-party clients. Documented anyway; expect breakage |

[WLED](wled-controller.md) is the worked `open_by_design` example, and it is
here partly to keep the distinction honest: a registry framed around liberating
documentation should be able to say when there was nothing to liberate. See
[Reading a Device Spec](../api/spec-format.md) for the field.
