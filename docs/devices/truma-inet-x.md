# Truma iNet X / iNet X Pro — Strict Read-Only

> **Status**: Spec available; untested on a bonded panel
> **Protocol**: BLE GATT, framed CBOR
> **Manufacturer**: Truma Gerätetechnik GmbH & Co. KG

## Scope and safety

The iNet X panel is a local BLE gateway to vehicle appliances. This spec is
limited to **topology and conditional telemetry**. Heating, cooling, hot water,
fans, pumps, switches, timers, fault resets, configuration, firmware and bond
management are excluded.

**Read-only still requires GATT writes** to announce and issue read requests.
The general community client's default discovery also emits
`client-system-time` and `client-last-message`; those change client state and
are not passive. Omit both, all `{tn,pn,v}` setters, measurement triggers and
install/demo operations. The reduced sequence still needs an owner-panel test.

The legacy **iNet Box** is a different protocol:
[ASCII `TRBT:` over Nordic UART](truma-inet-box.md). Never send one system's
frames to the other.

## Identity, pairing and recovery

| Role | UUID |
|---|---|
| Advertised service | `fc310001-f3b2-11e8-8eb2-f2801f1b9fd1` |
| Main service | `fc314000-f3b2-11e8-8eb2-f2801f1b9fd1` |
| Control | `fc314001-f3b2-11e8-8eb2-f2801f1b9fd1` |
| Request/write | `fc314002-f3b2-11e8-8eb2-f2801f1b9fd1` |
| Data/notification | `fc314003-f3b2-11e8-8eb2-f2801f1b9fd1` |
| Optional additional notification | `fc314004-f3b2-11e8-8eb2-f2801f1b9fd1` |
| Software revision | `00002a28-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` |

The name prefix is `Truma iNetX`, possibly only in a scan response. Community
evidence reports a rapidly rotating resolvable private address: **do not persist
the MAC or weaken host privacy**.

Pairing is reported as Just Works, accepted only in the panel's add-device mode,
with about four bond slots. Open that mode on the panel, scan by name/service,
bond, then subscribe to control and data. No passkey is reported. This was not
replayed by the project.

Rejoin with an existing bond and rediscover by name/service rather than MAC. A
new client needs a free add-device slot. Do not clear bonds or factory reset to
make telemetry work; no reset or standalone-unpair procedure is established.
Host-specific Linux/ESPHome reports are troubleshooting evidence, not a blanket
claim that an adapter cannot work.

## Frame format

All multi-byte header integers are little-endian; CBOR has its own encoding.

| Offset | Size | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | 2 | Target address/group |
| 2 | 2 | Source address/group |
| 4 | 2 | Declared body length |
| 6 | 2 | Operation |
| 8 | 8 | Sequence |
| 16 | 2 | Flags |
| 18 | variable | CBOR value when present |

Use the observed formulas:

```text
bodyLength = 1 + 8 + 2 + cborLength
physicalFrameLength = bodyLength + 7
```

Validate the complete physical length and header before decoding CBOR. A CBOR
decoder's offset search is not frame validation.

Useful read envelopes:

- **Protocol version**, operation 1: 25-byte request
  `0000ffff12000100000000000000000001c1a1627076820501`. The response supplies
  `pv` and assigned client `addr`; retain that source address for the session.
- **Topic registration**, operation 3, flags `0002`: CBOR `{tn: [...]}`.
- **Device list**, operation 2, flags `0001`: 18-byte header without CBOR.
  A reply may be `[0, {Devices: [group, ...]}]`.
- **Group read**, operation 3, flags `0004`: template
  `000000050b00030000000000000000000400`; replace target at offset 0 and
  learned client source at offset 2, both little-endian.

## Control exchange and fragmentation

1. Subscribe to control and data.
2. Announce on control: `01 <length_lo> <length_hi>`.
3. Wait for `81 00`, then write the complete request on request.
4. Wait for `f0 01` acceptance. This is transport progress, not a setting change.
5. On control `83 <length_lo> <length_hi>`, send `03 00`.
6. Reassemble data notifications to the announced length. Responses may queue,
   and a new frame can begin while older responses drain.
7. Acknowledge each flushed response with `f0 01`.

Do not rely only on the upstream trailing-fragment heuristic: a short first
fragment can be mistaken for trailing data after a completed response. Use
announced lengths and explicit frame state, then test real ATT/MTU splits.

## Telemetry model

Responses can be a record or `[context, record]`, with `topics`, `tn`, `pn`,
`v`, `type`, `min`, `max`, `enum`, `avail`/`a`, `perm` and `Devices`. Retain
**(source group, topic, parameter)** with every reading. Availability and
permission metadata do not prove hardware absence or authorize actuation.

Topic/group hints are not universal: heating often appears at `0201`,
tanks/switches at `0405`, room climate at `0101`, while one air conditioner
appeared at `0406`. Discover `Devices` and refresh device-supplied enums/ranges.

| Candidate | Reported meaning | Caveat |
|---|---|---|
| `AirHeating.Temp`, `WaterHeating.Temp` | Temperature | One example uses tenths of a degree C and rejects 65535; not universal |
| `FreshWater.Level`, `GreyWater.Level` | Tank level | Percent where supported; measurement-trigger writes excluded |
| `VBat.Voltage`, `L1Bat.Voltage` | Starter/leisure voltage | Retain source group |
| `LinePower.Plugged`, `System.Plugged` | Shore power | Different publishers can both report |
| `AirCirculation.FanLevel` | Fan level | Reported 0–10; read-only here |
| `AirHeating.Active`, `AirCooling.Active` | Running state | Type 105: 0 off, 1 running, 2 standby; do not apply to type 107 |
| `System.FlameStatus` | Heating activity | Follows gas or electric heat |
| `GasBtl.FillLevelW` | Gas contents | Kilograms on one reported LevelControl installation |
| `GasBtl.RemTime` | Unresolved raw value | Keep unitless; remaining-time interpretation not substantiated |

Redact `CertThumb`, `Muid`, `SerialNr`, `UniqueID`, `UserName`, `Uuid`, real
MACs, labels, raw identity responses and account data from diagnostics.

## Firmware and remaining validation

Vendor documentation says the app is required for panel updates. No update
transport is specified here. The first-generation operating guide reports a
fallback to the last installed software after an update failure, but wrong-image
and interrupted-transfer behavior still needs model-specific evidence.

Open items are live pairing/encryption, Panel 1/Panel 2 inventory, completeness
of the reduced strict-read sequence, ATT/MTU fragmentation, per-parameter
scales/sentinels and optional remote-module behavior. Upstream build/lint/70
tests and nine synthetic transport checks passed; they are not hardware proof.
