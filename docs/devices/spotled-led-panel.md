# SPOTLED LED Panels

> **Status**: Minimally verified, plus official-app multi-frame capture
> **Protocol**: BLE (legacy FF20 protocol; reported OTA and PIXELY extensions)
> **Manufacturer**: Host No.4 Technology (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. / generic OEM
> **Manufacturer Status**: Unsupported

## Overview

SPOTLED drives full-colour and monochrome LED matrix hats, badges, backpack
skins, chest panels and flexible signs under many reseller names. It includes
the [Lunchbox / LEDs 2 RAVE 4 Dream Skin](leds2rave4-lunchbox-led.md) 2.0 and
early 3.0. Recent DreamPanel v3 boards instead use
[iLEDColor](iledcolor-led-panel.md), an incompatible protocol.

SPOTLED 1.9.4 (2023) is the last release on Android and iOS. Local BLE control
does not depend on its account or cloud. PIXELY GLOW is a reseller-suggested
alternative; its reported v2/v3 extensions are not interchangeable with the
capture-proven legacy protocol below.

## Discovery and pairing

Known name prefixes are `LBXDRMSKIN_LED_` and `SpotLED_`. FF20 is useful when
advertised but can be absent from short advertisements. One tested panel also
advertised `00001812-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` and company `0x05D6`; **do not
match every HID-over-GATT device on 0x1812**. Confirm FF20/FF21/FF22 after
connecting.

Pairing is **not required**, but it is not true that pairing never happens:

- Bondless community clients work without a PIN or persistent bond.
- The official app initiates legacy Just Works pairing.
- The captured panel selects No Bonding, no MITM and no LTK distribution; the
  phone then enables encryption for that connection.

This is transient, unauthenticated pairing—not a durable owner credential.
Close the old central before reconnecting; power-cycle only for connection
recovery, not as a claimed factory wipe.

## Bootstrap

1. Connect and negotiate MTU; discover FF21/FF22 under FF20.
2. Enable FF21 notifications through the GATT client. If writing the CCCD
   directly, discover it and use the standard `01 00`, not bytes written to
   FF21 itself.
3. Send Version `04 10 00 00`, DisplayInfo `04 12 00 00` and BufferSize
   `04 14 00 00`, awaiting response types 17, 19 and 21.
4. Optionally query animation/text capability with `04 1a 00 00` (response 27).

The official app's fuller order is version → display → capability →
playlist/object queries → receive capacity. The three queries above are
sufficient for this documented upload path. Notifications are not ATT
read-back responses.

### Response layouts

Query responses 17, 19, 21 and 27 begin
`[length][type][serial_be16][status]`, with payload from byte 5 and success
status zero.

| Response | Full bytes | Fields after the common query header |
|---|---:|---|
| Version (17) | 15 | hardware type u16 BE, hardware version u32 BE, firmware version u32 BE |
| DisplayInfo (19) | 13 | width u16 BE, height u16 BE, colour type u8, advertised frames u8, brightness u8, font count u8 |
| BufferSize (21) | 9 | receive capacity u32 BE |

Transfer replies use two other layouts. Captured type-2 start and type-4
finish acknowledgements are seven bytes:
`[length][type][serial_be16][status][command_type_be16]`. Require status zero
and matching serial and command type. ContinueSending type 255 instead is ten
bytes: `[length][type][serial_be16][command_type_be16][resume_offset_be32]`.
It has no status byte; match its response type, serial and command type, then
use the offset at byte 6 rather than applying either status-bearing layout.
PauseSending type 254 is separate and was not captured.

Newer DisplayInfo responses may append a length-gated light-state byte. The
tested geometry was 96×16, colour type 255, advertised frame count 20,
brightness 100 and receive capacity 7280 bytes; none is a universal constant.

Colour types recovered statically are 16 = 1-bit mono, 128 = RGB332,
238 = RGB565 and 255 = RGB888. Type 49 selects the older RGB888 lattice record
6. Only RGB888/type-96 is capture-confirmed.

## BLE services

| UUID | Role | Properties / confidence |
|------|------|-------------------------|
| `0000ff20-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` | Legacy display service | Confirmed |
| `0000ff21-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` | Commands/responses | Write without response, notify; confirmed |
| `0000ff22-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` | Bulk display data | Write without response; confirmed |
| `0000ff10-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` | OTA service | Reported, not exercised |
| `0000ff11-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` | OTA instructions | Write/notify; reported |
| `0000ff12-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` | OTA data | Write/notify; reported |

Legacy FF21 frames are `[u8 length][u8 command_id][u16_be serial]
[u16_be command_type][u32_be command_length]`. Fixed queries use only the first
four bytes. The command channel has no checksum; do not add another framing
layer. Vendor serial counters wrap at 255 despite wider wire fields.

## Data records and checksum

FF22 legacy payloads have a 15-byte header: big-endian header length 15,
command `0x8004`, serial, content length and checksum. Records follow as
`[u32_be length][u16_be type][fields][checksum]`.

| Type | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 | Colour / character / character string / word stock |
| 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 | Lattice frame / time / effect / speed |
| 10 / 11 / 13 | Number bar / animation / font glyph |
| 14 | Brightness, 0–100 |
| 15 | Screen mode (value + two padding bytes): normal, upside-down, mirror, both |
| 96 | Dynamic colour frame: width, height, depth, bitmap |

Effects are 0 none, 1 up, 2 down, 3 left, 4 right, 5 stack, 6 expand, 7 laser.
The checksum sums the covered bytes; if the sum exceeds `0xff`, negate with
`(~sum)+1` and keep the low byte. A smaller sum is emitted unchanged.

## Upload flow control

1. Send SendingDataStart and require type 2 with status zero and matching
   serial and command type.
2. Serialize the complete payload once, then slice it into raw writes no larger
   than `MTU − 3`. Do not add a length or checksum to each ATT chunk.
3. Pace writes and respond to the device. The official app chose 182-byte
   writes after negotiating MTU 512; negotiated MTU alone does not select the
   application's chunk size.
4. ContinueSending type 255 carries the command type at bytes 4–5 and the
   offset to **resume from** at bytes 6–9. Use that offset, not the client's
   cursor, and do not apply either status-bearing response layout.
5. Send SendingDataFinish and require **type 4 with status zero and matching
   serial and command type**, not type 2. PauseSending type 254 alone does not
   diagnose MTU.

The official capture paused after exactly 7280 data bytes and resumed both
13902-byte three-frame transfers successfully.

## What the new capture proves

A supplied 2026-11-10 official-app capture contains seven reconstructed data
transactions, including font/text records, a one-frame RGB888 image and two
three-frame RGB888 animations. All declared lengths and checksums validate and
all finish responses are successful. Decoded 96×16 frames match camera images,
including RGB channel order. Each RGB888 frame record is 4620 bytes.

This resolves the older invisible-static-upload and three-frame capability
questions. Earlier custom-client three/eight-frame attempts failed, so their
serialization difference still needs investigation; the advertised 20-frame
field is not a proven arbitrary transfer limit. Other geometries,
monochrome/RGB332/RGB565, settings writes and factory reset remain open.

## OTA and PIXELY GLOW boundaries

Static app analysis identifies FF10/FF11/FF12 and this OTA sequence:

1. Command 80 presents whole-image CRC-16 (poly `0x1021`, init zero, MSB-first)
   and a u24 big-endian image length.
2. Command 81 obtains the acknowledgement window.
3. Command 82 streams image blocks on FF12 with per-window ACKs.
4. Command 83 asks whether the update completed.

OTA command IDs are little-endian 16-bit values. Metadata comes from the vendor
API, but no OTA session, image-signature policy, exact-model compatibility or
interrupted recovery was captured. **Do not replay an image from this documentary
sequence alone.**

PIXELY GLOW retains the legacy path on the captured panel and includes separate
protocol v2/v3 framing and request IDs. Those static extensions are recorded in
the YAML under `protocol_details.pixely_glow_extensions`; they need their own
advertisement-gated captures and must not be sent to every SPOTLED unit.

## Setup, reset and rebinding

No account or network provisioning is needed. Scan, connect, subscribe and
query. Rebinding is a fresh connection from another controller after closing
the old one; no persistent LTK bond was established in the capture. No factory
reset is established, and power-cycling is not claimed to erase content.
