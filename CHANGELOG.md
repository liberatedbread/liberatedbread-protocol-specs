# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- SPOTLED LED panel device doc, device spec and target starter — the OEM matrix-panel family
  (hats, badges, packs, banner signs) behind `com.led.spotled`, now the canonical home for the
  `0xFF20` protocol
- LED sign & panel design app survey (`docs/devices/led-sign-apps.md`) mapping design apps to
  device families, OEM platform clusters, and a triage checklist for unknown signs
- CoolLEDX / CoolLED1248 device doc, device spec and target starter — the unbranded BLE LED sign
  platform behind most AliExpress/Amazon car, bike, backpack and badge signs
- Target starters for iLEDColor (`com.led.iledcolor`), LED space (`com.yj.led`) and
  Divoom Pixoo (`com.divoom.Divoom`)
- OBD-II / vehicle diagnostics support: `docs/protocols/obd2-common.md` covering
  connectors (SAE J1962, ISO 19689), transports, ISO-TP framing, UDS services and
  capture methodology
- OBD-II Bluetooth adapter (ELM327 / STN) device doc and spec — BLE GATT families,
  Bluetooth Classic SPP, and the AT/ST command set
- Triumph Tiger 900 device doc, target spec and device spec, including the recovered
  service interval reset message (`33 <km/100>` / `34 <miles/100>` on CAN 0x701 to the
  instrument cluster) and the surrounding diagnostic surface — four separate stacks,
  UDS DIDs, DTC read/clear, ABS bleed, TPMS/immobiliser and instrument settings —
  derived from static analysis of the freeware TigerTool V3.51 and independently
  confirmed by decompiling TuneECU 23
- `obd` block and `obd2` protocol value in `device-specs/schema.json`, with a
  per-fact `verification` level so untested hypotheses cannot be mistaken for facts
- OBD-II device classification: `obd.role` (vehicle / adapter / module),
  `obd.adapter_profile` capability tiers (basic-clone, standards-elm327,
  advanced-stn, native-can), and per-request `command_class` (basic vs advanced)
  with a `requires` capability list, so a consumer can tell before connecting
  whether a given adapter can run a given command
- BMW motorcycle diagnostics device doc and spec — BMW's 0x6F1 D-CAN addressing with
  CAN extended addressing, the service interval data model (distance/date/valve-clearance),
  cluster-owned service data, module list, and the service reset itself — UDS
  WriteDataByIdentifier on BMW's 0xE1xx DIDs (`2E E1 2B/2C/2D`) with matching reads —
  recovered from the shipped MotoScan app
- BMW motorcycle / MotoScan target starter (`de.wgsoft.motoscan`) — the same
  service-interval-reset problem as the Triumph work, with an analysis plan and the
  observation that the app vendor also makes the UCSI-2100 adapter whose 255-byte
  message support exists because BMW's protocols need it
- Named OBD-II adapter coverage: UniCarScan UCSI-2100, OBDLink MX and OBDLink MX+,
  with per-model capability profiles, plus an `alt_can_bus` capability (Ford MS-CAN /
  GM SW-CAN) and a tool-requirement matrix covering FORScan, TuneECU, TigerTool,
  MotoScan, BimmerCode, OBD Fusion and Torque Pro
- `scripts/obd_discover.py` — read-only ECU and DID reconnaissance over an
  ELM327-class adapter, plus working vehicle modes: `--triumph-sia` /
  `--triumph-reset` for the Triumph cluster and `--bmw-scan` / `--bmw-module` for
  BMW's 0x6F1 addressing. The BMW scan supplies the module addresses the decompile
  did not; the Triumph reset reads state before and after and refuses to run
  without `--yes-write`
- Triumph odometer reply decoded from TigerTool's parser: `0D 01` answers
  `704 8D 01 <b1> <b2> <b3>`, a 24-bit big-endian value in kilometres, with
  `5E 01` -> `704 DE` flagging a TFT dash and selecting which mile divisor
  (1.60934 vs 1.6099895) the tool applies
- Initial project structure
- Device documentation template
- Getting started guides
- MkDocs Material theme configuration

### Changed

- Reframed the OBD-II guardrails for repair-café use: maintenance writes (service
  interval resets, TPMS sensor IDs, clearing recorded faults) are in scope and are the
  point, with a function-risk tier table and bench sequences for the Triumph and BMW
  service resets
- Coding, flashing, immobiliser and key work are documented and flagged
  `advanced: true` in the schema rather than excluded — reviving an old bike needs
  them. Only odometer falsification and work on a moving vehicle stay out

- LEDs2Rave4 / Lunchbox Dream LED docs now map each product generation to its design app
  (LED CHORD → SPOTLED → iLEDColor) and document the SPOTLED framed BLE protocol on `0xFF20`,
  corroborated against `python-spotled`
