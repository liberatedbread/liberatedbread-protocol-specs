"""LAN recon for a June Intelligent Oven.

Unlike the other ``*_discover.py`` scripts here, this one is expected to find
nothing. The June oven has no documented mDNS service, no SSDP announcement and
no local API: it is a pure outbound cloud client. That expectation is exactly
why the script exists — "we looked, with this command, and the oven answered on
no port" is a publishable result, and nobody has published it for any
generation.

So this reports negatives as findings rather than as errors, and every field it
emits is something a device spec can carry.

Usage::

    python scripts/june_discover.py --address 192.168.1.50
    python scripts/june_discover.py --address 192.168.1.50 --full --json
    python scripts/june_discover.py --mdns-only            # passive, no target

See ``docs/devices/june-oven-lan-recon.md`` for what to do with the output, and
for the passive-capture work that matters more than this scan does.
