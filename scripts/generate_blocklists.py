"""Generate DNS blocklists from the specs' ``cloud.egress`` entries.

A spec's ``cloud.egress`` says, per host, who contacts it (the device or only
the vendor's app), what the connection is for, and what blocking it costs. This
turns those facts into the formats people actually paste into a resolver:
hosts files, Pi-hole adlists, AdGuard Home rules, dnsmasq (OpenWrt), Unbound
(OPNsense / pfSense), RouterOS and RPZ.

Two profiles:

``updates``
    Only hosts with a ``firmware_check`` or ``firmware_download`` role. For an
    owner who still wants the vendor app away from home but not the update that
    removes the local protocol. Weaker than it sounds: it stops the update hosts
    the specs NAME, and vendors move update traffic without notice.
``cloud``
    Everything the device itself contacts. The DNS half of cutting it off.

Neither profile blocks a ``time`` host. A device that loses its clock loses
its schedules, so NTP hosts are REDIRECTED to a LAN NTP server when one is
given (``--time-server``) and otherwise listed in the header, never sinkholed;
a time source that is not NTP (an HTTPS API that also sets the clock) is left
reachable and named in the header. Hosts only the vendor's app contacts are
never listed: blocking them at the router breaks the app for every phone on
the network and does nothing to the device.
Entries whose ``when_blocked.impact`` is ``breaks`` are left out and named in
the header, and literal addresses (which DNS cannot touch) are listed there as
firewall rules instead.

A DNS list is the second layer, never the only one — see
https://liberatedbread.com/firewall/ for the firewall rule it backs up.

Usage::

    python scripts/generate_blocklists.py                  # write site/api/v1/blocklists/
    python scripts/generate_blocklists.py --check          # build everything, write nothing
    python scripts/generate_blocklists.py --coverage       # cloud specs with no egress yet
    python scripts/generate_blocklists.py --format dnsmasq --profile cloud \\
        --device tplink-kasa-smart-plug --time-server 192.168.1.53   # one list to stdout

The mkdocs post-build hook runs the first form into the built site, so the
published docs carry every list at a stable URL. Output is deterministic (no
timestamps), so a rebuild with unchanged specs is byte-identical.
