# GAPS.md

Last updated: 2026-08-23

This file is a record of the ORIGINAL 27-target research wave and what
became of it. It is not a live list of everything the catalogue is missing
-- the catalogue has roughly five times as many specs as that wave produced,
and per-spec gaps live in each spec's own `evidence` and
`remaining_unknowns` blocks, where the person who found them was standing.

## Remaining Gaps: 1

| Target | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **ifreqtech-speaker-mic** | No companion APK exists — BT Classic hardware bridge (HFP + likely SPP). Requires HCI snoop on physical device. RE blocked until hardware in hand. |

## Resolved: 27 of 27 original targets

## Resolved: m6-fitness-band (was "Uncertain")

RESOLVED 2026-07-31: the Veryfit 2.0 (`com.veryfit.multi`) app-to-device match was
positively REFUTED by the M6's own stock firmware dump (rbaron/m6-reveng) — no 0AF0
UUID exists anywhere in the 512 kB flash. The M6 is an LT716-platform device speaking
the FitPro protocol (NUS + 0xCD-framed commands + Telink OTA, advertised name "M6",
companion app `xfkj.fitpro`). `m6-fitness-band.yaml` was re-targeted accordingly and
keeps the Veryfit analysis only as a clearly-labeled mis-attribution note. See
`research/m6-fitness-band/CONFIRMATION.md` §C.

## Validation: 201/201 passing (200 device specs + 1 example)

Pinned by `test_gaps_md_states_the_real_spec_count` in
`scripts/test_device_specs.py`: this line said 92/92 for a fortnight after
the catalogue passed 130, which is the failure mode of every hand-written
count. It fails the suite now rather than quietly misleading a reader.
